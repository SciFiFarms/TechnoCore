# Some services don't come with any kind of authentication, which is **really** problematic
# when a service is exposed to the internet. Fortunantly Traefik provides a super simple auth
# mechinizium. However, this gets **very** annoying when doing development for those services.
# Setting this env disables that auth mechinisium.

# TODO: This breaks loading custom_components as the components are present in the host volume.
# Potential solution: Move custom_components into /var/lib/home-assistant/custom_components or something and then create a symlink from /config/custom_components to that path.
# Alternatively, rather than pulling libraries in on Docker build, continue to build into custom_components and use git subrepo to manage versions.
#       Might need to set up custom_components/src/ and then symlinc in the correct folders so that the config includes the module correctly.
